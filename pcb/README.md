# PCB

This is a PCB design that simplifies physical wiring between the cockpit controls and the *Leonardo*. The circuit schematic and the PCB layout are printed in the `pcb-schematic.pdf` and `pcb-layout.pdf` files respectively. The 3D support model is a printable part that allows a solid attachment of the PCB to the cockpit structure.
